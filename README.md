## Introduction


## Environment Setup

We tested this demo code with conda env:

```bash
python==3.12
conda install pytorch==2.2.2 torchvision==0.17.2 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

but i guess newer versions should also work perfectly.


Then, install the dependencies by:
```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
